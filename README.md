**deprecation**

So, this actually won't work anymore.

Github search only returns the first ~1000 items, that's why the
results are varying from one execution to another (and sometimes going to lower amounts).

We'll experiment with BigQuery to see if we can get a better picture of this.

Thanks!

# goreleaser-users

i wanted to know how many repos out there are using goreleaser, so
i wrote a little go using github search api to find out.

as for 2017-08-13 there are **266** (some of them are mine but yeah screw it).

i'm glad, thanks all!
